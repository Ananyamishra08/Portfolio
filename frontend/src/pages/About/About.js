              <p>

                MERN stack, GSAP animations, and Python-based AI models. An
                ambitious, persistent and hardworking engineer, interested in
                Full Stack Web Development and Cloud Computing . My main
                interest lies in the field of full stack development. I like to
                create innovative and interesting user interfaces using
                html,css,sass and javascript. I am very well aware of various
                javascript frameworks. I prefer backend-development with nodejs
                and express js. I extensively use mongoDB and mySQL as
                databases. I have also made some small computer vision projects
                using python libraries. Currently I am learning Python-based AI
                models. I embody the qualities like empathy and desire to help
                others and make worldÂ aÂ betterÂ place. I am always eager to
                collaborate and create cutting-edge solutions.
